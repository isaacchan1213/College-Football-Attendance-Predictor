# College Football Attendance Project

This is a final project I did for a databases class. In this project, my team and I developed models to analyze and identify the factors that influence college football attendance. 

## Project Overview

- **Team Leadership**: Led a team of 7 students in developing predictive models.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilized Scikit-learn to build models that predict factors affecting college football attendance.
- **Data Manipulation**: Employed Pandas to manipulate and analyze a dataset containing over 6000 games.
- **Data Visualization**: Used Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib to create visualizations and present findings.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the project or build upon it, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/college-football-attendance-project.git
    cd college-football-attendance-project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Analysis**: 

    Execute the analysis script to see the models and visualizations:

    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```

    Replace `analysis.py` with the actual script name if different.
