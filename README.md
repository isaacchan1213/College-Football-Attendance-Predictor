# College Football Attendance Project

This is a final project I did for a databases class. In this project, my team and I developed models to analyze and identify the factors that influence college football attendance. 

## Tech Stack

- **Data Analysis & Modeling**:
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - A Python library for machine learning, used to build models predicting factors affecting attendance.

- **Data Manipulation**:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle a dataset of over 6000 games.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - A Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations, used to present findings.
  
## Getting Started

To reproduce the project or build upon it, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/isaacchan1213/college-football-attendance-project.git
    cd college-football-attendance-project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Analysis**: 

    Execute the analysis script to see the models and visualizations:

    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```

    Replace `analysis.py` with the actual script name if different.

## Presentation

I also ended up presenting this slide in class with my team, please feel free to view the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FuUoeiLP1wAKdvaTfVSFjpYacLjRgAZ8oYRoZ1J9mZs/edit?usp=sharing).
